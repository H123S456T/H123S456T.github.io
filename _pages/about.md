I am currently an undergraduate student at **Xi'an Jiaotong University**, majoring in **Computer Science and Technology** (GPA: 3.86/4.3, Top 5%). My research interests focus on **multimodal large models**, **medical AI agents**, and **in-context learning**.

I have been fortunate to work with excellent researchers at top institutions:
- Currently working with Prof. Linfeng Zhang at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** on real-time video understanding
- Previously worked with Prof. Ziqing Li at **Westlake University** on medical reasoning with large language models

## Recent Highlights

🎉 **AAAI 2026 Oral Presentation**: Co-first authored paper on **MedLA**, a logic-driven multi-agent framework for complex medical reasoning with LLMs

🏆 **Awards**: 
- Lu Shidi Scholarship (2024, 2025)
- Lanqiao Cup Algorithm Design Competition, Provincial First Prize (2025)
- Mathematical Contest in Modeling, Honorable Mention (2024)

## Research Interests
