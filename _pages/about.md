## Research Experience

### Research on Streaming Video Understanding & Audio Benchmarks
**Shanghai Jiao Tong University, EPIC Lab** | *Research Intern* | Sept 2025 - Present  
Supervised by Prof. Linfeng Zhang

**Project: Streaming Video Model with Self-Improvement**
- Proposed a **self-evolution-based migration method** to transform standard video models into Streaming Video Models, addressing the challenge of real-time continuous video understanding
- Designed the inference format for streaming scenarios and constructed an **automated data synthesis pipeline** to generate high-quality training data, addressing the data shortage
- Validated the method's effectiveness via model migration testing (Targeting **ICML**)

**Project: Audio Model Benchmark**
- Establishing a comprehensive benchmark for **Long Context Audio** to evaluate the performance bottlenecks of large models on long sequences
- Contributed to the manuscript preparation and assisted in analyzing performance discrepancies of different models in long-context windows (Submitted to **ACL**)

**Key Skills:** Streaming Video Understanding, Self-Evolution Methods, Data Synthesis, Audio Benchmarking, Long-Context Processing

### Research on Medical Multi-Agent Frameworks (MedLA)
**Westlake University** | *Research Intern* | Apr 2025 - Sept 2025  
Supervised by Prof.  Stan Z. Li

**Publication: MedLA (AAAI 2026 Oral)**
- Addressed the lack of logical rigor in existing medical agents by proposing a **logic-driven multi-agent framework**
- The framework utilizes LLMs to build logic trees with **Syllogistic Triads** (major premise, minor premise, conclusion) and introduces **Graph-guided Discussion** to resolve contradictions, achieving **SOTA on MedDDx**
- Refined the core Syllogism methodology to enhance reasoning transparency and logic
- Conducted specific testing tasks to verify module effectiveness and drafted core sections of the paper

**Key Skills:** Multi-Agent Systems, Medical Reasoning, Syllogistic Logic, Graph-guided Discussion, Benchmark Evaluation

### Algorithm Internship at RWKV
**RWKV (Yuanshi Intelligence)** | *Algorithm Intern* | Sept 2025 - Dec 2025

- Completed **large-scale training data cleaning** by formulating rules to filter low-quality text
- Conducted systematic evaluations of the **RWKV model** on multiple NLP benchmark tasks, providing detailed data support for model iteration

**Key Skills:** Data Cleaning, NLP Benchmarking, Model Evaluation, Quality Control
