## About Me

I am currently an undergraduate student at **Xi'an Jiaotong University**, majoring in **Computer Science and Technology** (GPA: 3.86/4.3, Top 5%). My research interests focus on **multimodal large models** now. 

<div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;">
  <strong>🎓 Looking for PhD Opportunities (Fall 2027)</strong><br>
  I am actively seeking PhD positions starting in Fall 2027. I am particularly interested in research areas including multimodal large models, medical AI, and in-context learning. If you have any opportunities or would like to discuss potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out! <br><br>
  <strong>💼 Open to Research Internships</strong><br>
  I am also looking for research internship opportunities in AI/ML, especially in areas related to large language models, multimodal learning, and AI for healthcare. 
</div>

I have been fortunate to work with excellent researchers at top institutions:  
- Currently working with Prof.  Linfeng Zhang at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** on real-time video understanding
- Previously worked with Prof. Ziqing Li at **Westlake University** on medical reasoning with large language models

### Recent Highlights

🎉 **AAAI 2026 Oral Presentation**:  Co-first authored paper on **MedLA**, a logic-driven multi-agent framework for complex medical reasoning with LLMs

## Research Experience

### Research on Streaming Video Understanding & Audio Benchmarks
**Sept 2025 - Present**  
Research Intern | EPIC Lab, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. Linfeng Zhang

- Proposed a self-evolution-based migration method to transform standard video models into Streaming Video Models for real-time continuous video understanding
- Designed inference format for streaming scenarios and constructed automated data synthesis pipeline to generate high-quality training data (Targeting **ICML**)
- Establishing comprehensive benchmark for Long Context Audio to evaluate performance bottlenecks of large models on long sequences (Submitted to **ACL**)

### Research on Medical Multi-Agent Frameworks (MedLA)
**Apr 2025 - Sept 2025**  
Research Intern | Westlake University, supervised by Prof. Stan Z. Li

- Proposed a logic-driven multi-agent framework utilizing Syllogistic Triads (major premise, minor premise, conclusion) and Graph-guided Discussion to resolve contradictions, achieving SOTA on MedDDx
- Refined core Syllogism methodology to enhance reasoning transparency and conducted testing tasks to verify module effectiveness
- Co-first authored paper accepted for **Oral Presentation at AAAI 2026**

### Algorithm Internship at RWKV
**Sept 2025 - Dec 2025**  
Algorithm Intern | RWKV (Yuanshi Intelligence)

- Completed large-scale training data cleaning by formulating rules to filter low-quality text
- Conducted systematic evaluations of RWKV model on multiple NLP benchmark tasks, providing detailed data support for model iteration
