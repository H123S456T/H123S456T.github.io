**Research on Multimodal Large Models** (2025.9 - Present)  
*Remote Intern | Shanghai Jiao Tong University*  
Supervised by Prof. Linfeng Zhang

- Developing StreamingVideoModel, a novel framework for real-time understanding of continuous video streams in multimodal contexts
- Currently conducting extensive experiments to benchmark the model's performance on real-time action recognition tasks and validate its efficiency

**Research on Medical Agents** (2025.4 - 2025.9)  
*Remote Intern | Westlake University*  
Supervised by Prof. Ziqing Li

- Co-first authored a paper accepted for Oral Presentation at AAAI 2026, proposing MedLA, a novel logic-driven multi-agent framework to enhance LLM reasoning in complex medical tasks
- Innovated a self-checking optimization method to improve model reliability, designed and conducted key experiments to validate the framework's performance, and contributed to manuscript writing

**Research on In-Context Learning (ICL) in Large Models** (2024.9 - 2025.3)  
*Research Intern | Xi'an Jiaotong University*
