<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
<p>
Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective reasoning. We propose MedLA, a logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models.  Each agent organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on syllogistic triads, enabling transparent inference and premise-level alignment.
