## Research Experience

### Research on Multimodal Large Models (2025.9 - Present)
*Remote Intern | Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. Linfeng Zhang*

* Developing **StreamingVideoModel**, a novel framework designed for real-time understanding of continuous video streams.
* Designed a customized data format and constructed an automated synthesis pipeline to generate annotated video data, enabling system-wide test adaptation and robustness verification.
* Contributing to the manuscript preparation for a comprehensive **benchmark study** focused on large audio models.

### Research on Medical Agents (2025.4 - 2025.9)
*Remote Intern | Westlake University, supervised by Prof. Ziqing Li and Dr. Zelin Zang*

* **Co-first authored** a paper accepted for **Oral Presentation at AAAI 2026**, proposing MedLA, a logic-driven multi-agent framework to enhance LLM reasoning in complex medical tasks.
* Proposed a **syllogism-based medical answering system** equipped with self-checking mechanisms to ensure reliability, and validated the framework’s superior performance through extensive experiments.

### Research on In-Context Learning (ICL) (2024.9 - 2025.3)
*Research Intern | Xi’an Jiaotong University, supervised by Prof. Ning Ding*

* Investigated **In-Context Learning (ICL)** paradigms, specifically focusing on optimization strategies for in-context example selection.
* Assisted with experiments on example selection algorithms by implementing **data processing pipelines** and analyzing inference results.
