## Abstract

This paper introduces MedLA, a novel logic-driven multi-agent framework designed to enhance large language model reasoning in complex medical tasks. The framework incorporates a self-checking optimization method to improve model reliability.

## Key Contributions

- Proposed a logic-driven multi-agent framework for medical reasoning
- Developed a self-checking optimization method to improve model reliability
- Validated the framework's performance through extensive experiments
